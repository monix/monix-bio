/** INTERNAL API â€” Newtype encoding for types with one type parameter.
  *
  * The `Newtype1` abstract class indirection is needed for Scala 2.10,
  * otherwise we could just define these types straight on the
  * companion object. In Scala 2.10 definining these types
  * straight on the companion object yields an error like:
  * ''"only classes can have declared but undefined members"''.
  *
  * Inspired by

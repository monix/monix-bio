/** Internal API — A reference that boxes a `FrameIndex` possibly
  * using a thread-local.
  *
  * This definition is of interest only when creating
  * tasks with `Task.unsafeCreate`, which exposes internals,
  * is considered unsafe to use and is now deprecated.
  *
  * In case the [[Task]] is executed with
  * [[monix.execution.ExecutionModel.BatchedExecution BatchedExecution]],
  * this class boxes a `FrameIndex` in order to transport it over
  * light async boundaries, possibly using a
  * [[monix.execution.misc.ThreadLocal ThreadLocal]], since this
  * index is not supposed to survive when threads get forked.
  *
  * The `FrameIndex` is a counter that increments whenever a
  * `flatMap` operation is evaluated. And with `BatchedExecution`,
  * whenever that counter exceeds the specified threshold, an
  * asynchronous boundary is automatically inserted. However this
  * capability doesn't blend well with light asynchronous
  * boundaries, for example `Async` tasks that never fork logical threads or
  * [[monix.execution.schedulers.TrampolinedRunnable TrampolinedRunnable]]
  * instances executed by capable schedulers. This is why
  * [[FrameIndexRef]] is part of the `Context` of execution for
  * [[Task]], available for asynchronous tasks that get created with
  * `Task.unsafeCreate` (which is now deprecated).
  *
  * Note that in case the execution model is not
  * [[monix.execution.ExecutionModel.BatchedExecution BatchedExecution]]
  * then this reference is just a dummy, since there's no point in
  * keeping a counter around, plus setting and fetching from a
  * `ThreadLocal` can be quite expensive.
